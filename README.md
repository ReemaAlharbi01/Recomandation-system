By using the STC TV dataset from Misk Virtual Work, I developed a recommendation system for series and movies. The system recommends it based on:

first, finding similar users

Second, search for similar user preferences by using the ratings.

Third, mash the Similler users preference data with this user to display an effective recommendation system for the movies and series.
